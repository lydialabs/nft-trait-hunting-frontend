# Ascension Area

Ascension Arena is an NFT-based game that allows users to experience free minting, combine items, and craft their unique item using generative AI. The game will be built on Archwayâ€™s unique and inclusive rewards model, where more people minting and merging items will directly benefit the team to make the game sustainable.

For the purpose of the hackathon, the demo will allow users to freely mint as many common swords as they want. There will be 3 tiers in total for this demo: common, rare, legendary. By combining swords of the same type together, there will be a 50% chance that the merge results in a rare sword and a 30% chance that the merge results in a legendary sword. The higher tier sword will inherit traits of existing swords that are merged. As a result, every individual will have an opportunity to craft their unique legendary sword NFT.

Ascension Arena is a good example of Archway projects that utilizes the latest generative AI trends and unique reward structure of Archway blockchain. We believe that its success can help the Archway NFT ecosystem become vibrant and also generate a lot of transactions for the network.
